This shader calculates the distance between the position of the vertex and the camera, it is possible to use a parametrized point
 and change it through C#.

Note that I used a custom chader that gets a Noise 3D function from the "3D Noise.hlsl" file so that I can map noise on
 all sides of the mesh without unwrapping the mesh.


See my tutorial on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH_JWC1fpkI
 at that time I decided to use triplanner mapping instead of a 3D Noise.
