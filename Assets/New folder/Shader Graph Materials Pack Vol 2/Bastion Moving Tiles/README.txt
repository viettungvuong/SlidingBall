This shader has a point parameter which you can change using "Shader.SetGlobalVector("_Player_Position", Vector3);" from a C# script, the MovePlayerAndSetShaderPosition script
in the same folder is attached to the capsual and it will move the player back and forth and set the shader parameter to make the effect work.
